# Custom Build Guide

[Back to README](./README.md) | [中文](../zh/custom-build.md) | English

If your goal is to **quickly create your own image**, the easiest and most recommended option is **Custom Build** in GitHub Actions.

It now uses an explicit tuple model:

- `base_system`
- `include_docker`
- `output_formats`

So instead of choosing a legacy variant name, you directly describe the image you want.

---

## Quick start in 3 minutes

### Step 1: Open Actions

In your own fork of the repository:

- Click **Actions** in the top navigation bar
- Find **Custom Build** in the left sidebar
- Click **Run workflow**

---

### Step 2: Choose the base tuple

For a first run, start with:

- `base_system=debian`
- `include_docker=false`
- `output_formats=img`

A simple way to think about the common combinations:

- `debian + false`: most general-purpose, recommended for first-time users
- `debian + true`: Debian image with Docker included
- `alpine + false`: lighter image
- `alpine + true`: lighter image with Docker included

And for output formats:

- `img`: the core format used for testing and raw-disk import
- `vmdk`: useful when you specifically need VMDK
- `ova`: useful for PVE import

If you just want your first successful build, use **`debian + false + img`**.

---

### Step 3: Fill in parameters as needed

#### Scenario A: You only want to change network settings

You can enter:

- `lan_server_ip=192.168.50.1`
- `lan_range_start=192.168.50.100`
- `lan_range_end=192.168.50.200`
- `lan_netmask=24`

#### Scenario B: You also want to change passwords

You can additionally enter:

- `root_password=Passw0rd!234`
- `api_username=admin`
- `api_password=Adm1n!234`

#### Scenario C: You also want to select tests

You can use `run_test` to choose what runs after the image build:

- empty / `none`: build only
- `readiness`
- `readiness,dataplane`

Note:

- when `include_docker=true`, requested dataplane is skipped explicitly with a reason in the logs

#### Other common input

- `landscape_version`
  - The Landscape version to build
  - If left blank, the repository default is used

Current precedence:

**direct inputs > secrets > defaults**

---

### Step 4: Run the workflow

After filling in the options, click:

- **Run workflow**

---

### Step 5: Use the latest successful build links

After the workflow finishes, you can still download the Artifacts.

But the recommended path now is the fixed release entry:

- Release page: `https://github.com/<owner>/landscape-mini/releases/tag/custom-build-latest`
- Direct download base: `https://github.com/<owner>/landscape-mini/releases/download/custom-build-latest/<asset>`

That fixed release always points to the latest successful Custom Build, regardless of tuple:

- old assets are removed first
- new assets from the latest successful build are uploaded afterward
- `build-metadata.txt` and `effective-landscape_init.toml` are updated alongside them

So if you run Debian first and Alpine later, the later Alpine run replaces the earlier Debian assets at the same tag.

The output usually includes:

- the raw image `.img` or a stable renamed asset
- build metadata `build-metadata.txt`
- the resolved configuration `effective-landscape_init.toml`
- and, if requested, `.vmdk` / `.ova`

If you need immutable per-build outputs, use the Artifacts from that workflow run or record its `run_id` / `artifact_id`.

## How to choose a tuple

### What should I pick for my first run?

Use:

- `base_system=debian`
- `include_docker=false`
- `output_formats=img`

### I want Docker

Set:

- `include_docker=true`

### I want a lighter image

Set:

- `base_system=alpine`

### I want to import into PVE

Set:

- `output_formats=img,ova`

Notes:

- `ova` is the canonical workflow input name
- the downloadable output is still a `.ova` file

That gives you both:

- a raw `.img` for testing and fallback
- an `.ova` for import workflows
- the current OVA defaults are PVE-oriented: 2 vCPUs, 2G RAM, and a virtio NIC
- if you want CPU type `host`, set it manually after import; it is not inherited reliably from OVF metadata today

---

## What can you do after the build finishes?

After you have successfully run Custom Build once, you can also use:

- **Test Image**

This is useful for:

- re-running validation on an existing artifact
- running readiness or dataplane checks afterward
- testing again with different SSH or API credentials

The retest entry points are now:

- `run_id`
- `artifact_id`

In other words, retests target a concrete build artifact directly rather than depending on older suffix naming conventions.

## FAQ

### What should I choose for my first run?

Choose:

- `base_system=debian`
- `include_docker=false`
- `output_formats=img`

### Does `ova` replace `.img`?

No.

It is recommended to keep `img` and add `ova` when needed.

### Why does dataplane sometimes not run?

The rule is:

- `run_test=` or `run_test=none` → no tests
- `run_test=readiness` → readiness only
- `run_test=readiness,dataplane` with `include_docker=false` → readiness + dataplane
- `run_test=readiness,dataplane` with `include_docker=true` → dataplane is skipped explicitly

That is based on the unified test contract and capability rules, not on legacy variant names.

## One-line recommendation

If your goal is:

> **“I want to create my own image as quickly as possible.”**

Start with:

- `debian + no-docker + img`

Get your first image working first, then decide whether to add Docker, switch to Alpine, or request `vmdk` / `ova`.
